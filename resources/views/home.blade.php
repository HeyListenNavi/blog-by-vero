                    Welcome to my blog! my name is Ver√≥nica, i'm currently a computer science student who wants to
                    learn way too many things and has way too many "to do projects", i'm a woman who loves to make
                    things her own, either by making them herself or customizing them, i often feel like it's a
                    weird way of self-expression i've developed.
                    <br/>
                    i love musicals, particle physics, math, programming, electronics, videogames, and much more
                    stuff you can read about in my "about me" page :3
                </p>

        <div class="description--site">
            <h2>about the site</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <x-window title="old home">
                    <video controls=true>
                        <source src="{{ Vite::image('home-video.mp4') }}" type="video/mp4" />
                    </video>
                </x-window>
                <p>
                    i really enjoy browsing sites in neocities, so when i saw people were making their own websites
                    for fun, i got inspired by a few different sites that i found and decided to make my own after
                    instagram didn't let me upload a couple photos i had taken (ctm instagram üñï) and so this
                    website was made as a way to store thoughts, writings, pictures, and other stuff that i'd
                    usually upload to social media.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    i made the website unnecessarily complicated so i could not only have fun making it, but also
                    learn to get more comfortable using the Rust programming language.
                    <br/>
                    i love Rust, it's been the main programming language i use and i just wanted to implement it
                    into this project too, so when i found that you could use WebAssembly to create websites and
                    much more, i just had to use it, in order to make this a bit easier, i used the Yew framework to
                    make the frontend.
                    <br/>
                    as for the backend, i decided to make a simple server that would store various assets and the
                    posts of my journal in Markdown and turn them into HTML when requested, although i'm planning to
                    add much more things to it. this was done using the Actix Web framework, again... in Rust.

                overall, it was a pretty interesting experience, and i believe i learned a lot from this, i think
                everyone should try to make their own website if they have time, specially if you're a fan of the
                indie web, profile customization, and things like that
